## __:whale: Python3 wrapper for whaleclub REST api:__

PyWhale is a python3 wrapper for [whaleclub.co REST api](http://docs.whaleclub.co/#overview). [Whaleclub.co](https://whaleclub.co/) in addition of offering a demo mode for newcomers, is a great trading exchange platform having one of the best UI and support service I've saw so far. 

PyWhale was created to keep things as simple and intuitive as possible while performing complex requests to REST api. It contains all functions available in [whaleclub.co REST api documentation](http://docs.whaleclub.co/#overview) allowing user to get simultaniously up to 5 markets price, place live or turbo trades, easily switch between real/demo mode or BTC/DASH trading and much more. For better user experience, I've took the liberty to reformat whaleclub.co api functions documentation into functions doc string so one could access all relevants informations directly.

As far as I know, PyWhale is the only alternative language available if you can't (or just do not want to) use the javascript wrapper in order to interact with whaleclub REST api. PyWhale was created in collaboration with Charles Smith with the idea of using it as a based to create trading bots.

## __Dependencies:__

* Requests
* Statistics

## __Installation:__
    $ pip3 install pywhale

## __How to use it:__

After creating an account (just click on above referral links if you don't have one yet), get your API token from your API Settings panel which is available from the top right menu in your trading dashboard. You get one token for live trading and another for demo trading for each BTC/DASH cryptocurrencies.

Then copy/paste each api key in the respective following files:

- {pywhale installation folder}/api_keys/BTC_demo_key.txt
- {pywhale installation folder}/api_keys/BTC_real_key.txt
- {pywhale installation folder}/api_keys/DASH_demo_key.txt
- {pywhale installation folder}/api_keys/DASH_real_key.txt
- {pywhale installation folder}/api_keys/ETH_real_key.txt
- {pywhale installation folder}/api_keys/LTC_real_key.txt

if you don't know your "pywhale installation folder", you could find it in an error message by typing in a ipython3 terminal

    $ from pywhale.PyWhale import PyWhale

##### __*Beware to not invert api key, this step is critical so I strongly advise that you check that part twice.*__

## __Usage:__

##### __Lets do some Whaly stuff:__
    
    $ from pywhale.PyWhale import PyWhale
    $ pw = PyWhale()  
    
![Alt text](/picts/pw.jpg?raw=true "pywhale logo")

##### __See all available PyWhale functions:__

    $ pw.help()
    
![Alt text](/picts/help.jpg?raw=true "pywhale logo")

##### __See all relevants functions informations and input parameters:__

    $ print (pw.function_name.__doc__)
    
![Alt text](/picts/balance.jpg?raw=true "pywhale logo")


##### __Switch between real/demo mode & BTC/DASH trading:__

In PyWhale, you could easily switch between real/demo mode & BTC/DASH trading by directly passing key value in function inputs so you don't have to memorize several functions to do the same thing for each mode.

###### __Possible key values:__

- 'BTC_real_key'
- 'BTC_demo_key'
- 'DASH_real_key'
- 'DASH_demo_key'
- 'ETH_real_key'
- 'LTC_real_key'

###### __Examples:__

    # Create a new turbo position for DASH demo mode
    $ pw.createNewTurboPosition(market='BTC-USD',position_direction='long',position_type='5min',size=100000,key='DASH_demo_key')

The previous approach works well if you want to change real/demo mode & BTC/DASH trading punctually, but if you have planned just trading using only one mode this could get quickly tedious. For this reason, I've set a default_key attribute that could be changed once and will be then used automatically as the default key parameter value while calling further functions. 

In other words, if you don't pass a key parameter value while calling a function, default.key attribute value will be used.
You should note that after creating a PyWhale instance, default_key attribute value is 'BTC_demo_key' so you could safely call functions without any fears of using your real balance from starts.

    # Display actual default_key attribute
    $ pw.default_key
    
    # Change default_key attribute
    $ pw.default_key = 'DASH_demo_key'
    
![Alt text](/picts/default_key.jpg?raw=true "pywhale logo")


##### __Want just ipython output?:__

$ pw.verbose = False
